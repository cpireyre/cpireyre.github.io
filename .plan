* deploy on github pages
* playable prototype
use BABYLON.PhysicsRaycastResult() for collision?
debug display (fps, keys, pos, etc)
brett victor style live editable state for e.g. colors
tigerbeetle style dependency injection for inputs etc
rich hickey style rule-based engine?

* better collision logic
* use emissiveColor and mirrorMaterial
* live edit object color
* display current score
pop-up editor would be cooler and less intrusive
bounce physics still fake
code a mess
mirrorMaterial performance considerations?
save color settings etc. to local storage
slider for ball speed (good for debug)
accelerate during game
try some post processing shaders?
